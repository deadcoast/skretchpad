[LanguageTool](https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool) is a style and grammar checker.

## Files

LanguageTool will run on files with the following extensions:

* `.md`
* `.mdx`
* `.markdown`
* `.txt`

The following files are excluded:

* `CMakeLists.txt`
* `requirements.txt`

## Configuration

LanguageTool's style and grammar check depends on the language selected in CodeRabbit's configuration. You can set the language by setting the `language` field in your project's `.coderabbit.yaml` file or setting the "Review Language" field in CodeRabbit's settings page.

CodeRabbit allows further configuring LanguageTool by setting specific rules and categories to be enabled/disabled. This can be done under the `reviews.tools.languagetool` field in your project's `.coderabbit.yaml` file or setting the various options under "Review → Tools → LanguageTool" in CodeRabbit's settings page. The following options are available:

* `enabled` - Enable or disable LanguageTool.
* `enabled_rules` - Enable specific rules.
* `disabled_rules` - Disable specific rules.
* `enabled_categories` - Enable specific categories.
* `disabled_categories` - Disable specific categories.
* `enabled_only`- Enable only the rules and categories of IDs are specified with 'enabledRules' or 'enabledCategories'.
* `level` - Set the level of feedback to be provided by LanguageTool. The following levels are available:
  * `default` - Provides feedback on common issues.
  * `picky` - Provides feedback on more issues, rules that you might only find useful when checking formal text.

## Default disabled categories and rules

The following categories are disabled by default:

* `TYPOS` - Typo detection
* `TYPOGRAPHY` - Typography issues
* `CASING` - Casing issues

The following rules are disabled by default:

* `EN_UNPAIRED_BRACKETS` - Unpaired brackets
* `EN_UNPAIRED_QUOTES` - Unpaired quotes

## Profile behavior

In **Chill** mode, LanguageTool filters out noisy rule patterns:

* `QB_NEW_EN*` - Experimental "There might be a mistake here" rules that generate many false positives

In **Assertive** mode, all findings are reported.
