> Learn how to control and manage CodeRabbit's automatic code reviews with commands. Pause, resume, ignore reviews, request manual reviews, resolve comments, and update pull request summaries using @coderabbitai commands.

You can control CodeRabbit's behavior with a specific pull request by mentioning the username of its bot, `@coderabbitai`, alongside keywords in comments or the pull request description, as specified by the next sections of this page.

For a complete CodeRabbit command reference, see [Code review command reference](/reference/review-commands).

## Control automatic code reviews

By default, CodeRabbit automatically reviews every new pull request created in your repository. It updates its review with comments whenever the pull request has new commits pushed to it.

The following sections show you how to tell CodeRabbit to modify this behavior with a specific pull request, such as pausing reviews, or resolving open comments.

For more information about permanently configuring the behavior of CodeRabbit on your repository, see [Add a configuration file](/getting-started/yaml-configuration).

### Pause and resume automatic code reviews

You can tell CodeRabbit to pause its automatic reviews of a pull request. If you do, then you can still manually request CodeRabbit to review changes using the commands listed on [Code review command reference](/reference/review-commands).

To pause automated reviews of a pull request, post the following comment to the pull request:

```md  theme={null}
@coderabbitai pause
```

To resume automated reviews after pausing them, post the following comment to the pull request:

```md  theme={null}
@coderabbitai resume
```

### Disable automatic code reviews

To disable automatic code reviews for a pull request, add the following line anywhere in the pull request description:

```md  theme={null}
@coderabbitai ignore
```

As long as that text remains in the description, CodeRabbit will not automatically review any commits associated with that pull request. You can still chat with CodeRabbit and issue other commands in the pull request comments.

To enable automatic reviews on that pull request, delete "`@coderabbitai ignore`" from the pull request description. CodeRabbit commences automatic reviews starting with the next commit made to the branch under review.

<Tip>
  Use `auto-review` [configuration
  setting](/reference/configuration#param-auto-review) to control which requests
  should not be reviewed automatically (choose base branches, ignore drafts,
  skip bot users, etc.)
</Tip>

## Manually request code reviews

You can ask CodeRabbit to perform a code review at any time. This can be useful when you have paused automated code reviews. Manually requested reviews have two types:

* A *full review* disregards any comments that CodeRabbit has already made on this pull request, and generates a complete review of the entire pull request.

* An *incremental review* takes all comments that CodeRabbit has made since its most recent full review into consideration, and generates a review of only the new changes.

To manually request a full review, post the following comment to the pull request:

```md  theme={null}
@coderabbitai full review
```

To manually request an incremental review, post the following comment to the pull request:

```md  theme={null}
@coderabbitai review
```

## Resolve comments

To have CodeRabbit mark all of its previous comments as resolved, post the following comment to the pull request:

```md  theme={null}
@coderabbitai resolve
```

## Update information about the pull request

The commands in this section request CodeRabbit to generate and post updated information about the pull request itself.

### Update the summary text

To have CodeRabbit update the generated summary of the branch’s proposed changes to the pull request’s description, post the following comment:

```md  theme={null}
@coderabbitai summary
```

CodeRabbit updates the summary text to the description under the heading "Summary by CodeRabbit".

### Diagram the pull request history

To have CodeRabbit post a comment that contains a sequence diagram which visualizes the history of the pull request under review, post the following comment:

```md  theme={null}
@coderabbitai generate sequence diagram
```

## Get information about CodeRabbit

The commands in this section request CodeRabbit to display its own configuration or documentation.

### Display current configuration

To have CodeRabbit post a comment listing out its current configuration with your repository, post the following comment to the pull request:

```md  theme={null}
@coderabbitai configuration
```

### Display a quick-reference guide

To have CodeRabbit post a comment to the pull request with a quick-reference guide to its own commands and other features, post the following comment to the pull request:

```md  theme={null}
@coderabbitai help
```
