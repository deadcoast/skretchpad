        Mobile & Expo best practices:
        - Proper use of Expo APIs and hooks (useRouter, useFonts, useAssets)
        - Accessibility: touch targets min 44x44, screen reader support
        - Safe area handling and platform-specific code (iOS vs Android)
        - Memory leaks in useEffect and event listeners

        Performance:
        - Use FlatList/SectionList for lists (never ScrollView with .map)
        - StyleSheet.create instead of inline styles
        - React.memo, useMemo, useCallback where appropriate

        TypeScript:
        - Avoid 'any', use explicit types
        - Prefer 'import type' for type imports

        Security:
        - No exposed API keys or sensitive data
        - Use expo-secure-store for sensitive storage
        - Validate deep linking configurations

        Internationalization:
        - User-visible strings should be externalized to resource files (i18n)

    # Expo app configuration
    - path: 'app.json'
      instructions: |
        Review Expo configuration for:
        - Proper app versioning (version and build numbers in sync)
        - Required permissions are justified and minimal
        - Splash screen and icon configurations are complete
        - Deep linking schemes are properly configured
        - EAS build configuration is production-ready
        - No exposed secrets or API keys in configuration

    # EAS (Expo Application Services) build configuration
    - path: 'eas.json'
      instructions: |
        Review EAS Build/Submit configuration for:
        - Environment-specific configurations (development, preview, production)
        - Proper credential management
        - Build profiles are optimized for their purpose
        - iOS bundle identifiers and Android package names are correct
        - Distribution settings align with deployment strategy

    # Metro bundler configuration (React Native's JavaScript bundler)
    - path: 'metro.config.js'
      instructions: |
        Review Metro bundler configuration for:
        - Asset extensions are properly registered
        - Transformer configuration is optimal for project needs
        - Source map generation is appropriate for environment
        - No security issues with resolver configuration

    # Test files
    - path: '**/*.test.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}'
      instructions: |
        Review test files for:
        - Comprehensive coverage of React Native component behavior
        - Proper use of @testing-library/react-native
        - Mock implementations for Expo modules and native APIs
        - Async behavior is properly tested
        - Accessibility testing is included

    # Asset files (images, fonts, etc.)
    - path: 'assets/**/*'
      instructions: |
        Review asset files for:
        - Image optimization (size and format appropriate for mobile)
        - Proper @2x and @3x variants for different screen densities
        - SVG assets are optimized
        - Font files are licensed and optimized
```
