 STANDARDS NOTE::ADHERE_BEFORE_ACTIONS::"""[1] correction is developing, populating, and integrating. [2] correction is NOT removing features, placeholders, or unused variables. Doing so will create more errors and cascade into over correction: "the removal of one errored function resulted in a string of error removals. The end 'correct' codebase that resulted ran, compiled, but had no purpose or function anymore. To circumvent this REMOVING FEATURES UNTILL IT COMPILES."""

Wow! how profound, i cant believe you did that all so fast.

Run it. It should run right away then. I dont want to hear from you again untill it runs with the above standards met. I have no more valuable input for you, other than to develop the game, and do not DELETE the code i have written. If you want to improve it, then [DO_SO].
