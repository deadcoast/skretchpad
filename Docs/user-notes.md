# USER NOTES

## REVISIONS

- ICONOGRAPHY, EMOJIS NEED COMPLETE OVERHAUL
  - Introduce an 'icon library' that can be swaped out, and themed.
  - ALL emojis need to be replaced with custom icons, that match the design language of the app.
  - ALL icons need to be optimized for color and shape, to match the design language of the app.

- When the pin or eye button is clicked on the top menu, it dissapears, and does not return to the 'off' state until the app is reloaded.
  - The pin and eye buttons need to be 'toggled', and return to their original state when clicked again.(aswell as replaced with the correct new icons)

## APP STYLE AND DESIGN

### MAIN DESIGN AESTHETIC

- MINIMAL RETRO FUTURISM
  - The design should evoke a sense of nostalgia for the user, while also being modern and sleek.
  - The design should be minimal, and not distract the user from the content they are working on.
  - The design should be clean, and easy to read
  - Inspired by: Retro analog sci-fi, retro computing, and modern minimalism
