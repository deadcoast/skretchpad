## Release Baseline

- Project version: `0.1.0` (`package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`)
- Latest changelog entry: `0.1.0` in `Docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- Scope of this report: build/test health + documentation parity checkpoints

## Integrated Highlights (v0.1.0)

### Security/Runtime

- Canonical path boundary enforcement for plugin filesystem capabilities.
- Verified trust signature requirement enforced fail-closed.
- Hardened plugin command execution path and workspace-root alignment.
- Symlink-aware directory listing (`symlink_metadata`) for accurate explorer behavior.

### Editor and Explorer UX

- File-open argument normalization fixed (`map` vs `string` payload mismatch).
- `File -> Open Folder...` integrated into command routing and explorer root switching.
- Explorer is visible by default and now supports drag-resizable width with persistence.
- Hidden file/folder handling improved for dot-prefixed entries and control docs.
- Status bar `Ln/Col` and selection now update live from active editor state.

### Theme/Visual

- MilkyText dark baseline updated:
  - window base `#0A0A0E`
  - chrome background `#0D0E13`
  - subtle surface `#12131b`
- App shell fallbacks aligned to new baseline.
- Window control colors now derive from theme palette variables.

## Current Known Gaps

- Cryptographic plugin signature verification is implemented with Ed25519 payload verification; key lifecycle is now persisted but still needs production key distribution/rotation policy.
- Plugin architecture remains transitional: `src/lib/plugin-api.ts` exists as a typed wrapper for implemented commands, but broader extension-surface parity from historical docs is still incomplete.
- Git plugins are minimal sandbox scripts (`plugins/git/main.js`, `plugins/git-status/main.js`) and are treated as legacy examples; they are not auto-activated by default because Rust/store Git is canonical.
- Shelved roadmap items remain intentionally deferred and are tracked separately.

## Important Clarification

- This status file is not a full feature-completeness sign-off.
- Passing build/lint/tests indicates verified stability for covered paths, not that all planned architecture capabilities are complete.
- Historical planning/audit language should be treated as context unless reaffirmed in current release reports and live source checks.

## Historical vs Current Convention

- `Current-state claims`: statements in this report are tied to verified source paths and recent validation commands.
- `Historical references`: older architecture/audit narratives remain useful context, but do not override current source verification.
- `Conflict rule`: if historical wording conflicts with live source, live source + current report status is authoritative.

## Documentation Validation Status

- [x] `Docs/CHANGELOG.md` updated to `0.1.0` and normalized.
- [x] `Docs/plans/audit/AUDIT_2025-10-28.md` validated with addendum.
- [x] `Docs/plans/audit/AUDIT-2026-02-10.md` validated with remediation addendum.
- [x] `Docs/plans/spec/v0.1.0.md` created from prior spec baseline.
- [x] `Docs/reports/STATUS_2026-02-10.md` refreshed to live metrics.
- [x] `Docs/TODO.md` refreshed for maintenance-completion tracking.
- [x] `Docs/plans/shelved/FUTURE-FEATURES.md` baseline refreshed and deduplicated against completed work.
